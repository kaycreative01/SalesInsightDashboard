# SalesInsightDashboard
My senior seminar project is centered on crafting an impactful Tableau dashboard using SQL
and encompassing a substantial amount of entries from an e-commerce sales dataset spanning
diverse market segments including consumer, home office, and corporate. With a wide spectrum
of products offered, ranging from technology to office supplies, furniture, etc. The dataset
represents a dynamic business environment. The project's focus point is to display the power of
data visualization while designing valuable insights within Tableau. By transforming raw sales
data into comprehensive visualizations, the dashboard becomes a strategic asset for the
viewer/business. This visualization dashboard will offer detailed views of key performance
metrics and sales trends and also an added analysis of individual segments and product
categories. By simplifying complex data through visualization, the dashboard becomes a catalyst
for strategic business decisions, resource allocation, and market adaptation. The goal of the
project is to symbolize the relationship between technical innovation and data visualization while
using a sales analysis approach.
